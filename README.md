# ContactsApp

## Design & Architecture - 

We have chosen MVVM architecture along with Protocol Oriented programming to avoid code repetition.


## Highlights

- Using Permission priming to educate the user about contact privacy

- We created a Network library to parse models into desired data structures which would help us for testing.

- We have given the privilege of making the app Arabic friendly but work is still in progress.

## Improvement Points

- Core Data injection to avoid reading contacts again from System API
- App Localization & Internationalization
- 


## WIP

- Contact Selection Handling [API stopped working]
