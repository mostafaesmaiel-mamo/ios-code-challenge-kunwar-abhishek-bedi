# ContactsApp

## Design & Architecture - 

- MVVM with Protocol Oriented Programming
- UICollectionViewCompositionLayout


## Highlights

- Using Permission priming to educate the user about contact privacy
- We created a Network library to parse models into desired data structures which would help us for testing.
- We have given the privilege of making the app Arabic friendly but work is still in progress.


## Improvement Points

- Core Data injection to avoid reading contacts again from System API
- App Localization & Internationalization
- Adding Onboarding experience
- UICollectionview Diffable data source could be used for optimization


## WIP

- Contact Selection Handling [API stopped working]
- Contact Details Screen is implemented with random contact info
